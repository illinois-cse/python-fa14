Code profiling involves polling the current location of execution every few milliseconds or so and forming a table of the functions called together with how much time is spent in each.  This gives you the information you need to make educated decisions about optimization.  For instance, once you know that a specific numerical routine is eating up 90% of your program time, you may change the algorithm or parallelize the process.  This lets you spend your precious time optimizing the _right_ portion of the code, rather than functions or loops that are called only a few times."
