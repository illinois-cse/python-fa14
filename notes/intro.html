<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">This</a> is like an online version of your graphing calculator, and you can do some cool math calculations with it.</p>
<p>But what have you actually been doing here? Programming!</p>
<p>We use programming in this kind of a small way every day. Why? It saves us a lot of time.</p>

<p>Great! I get it. Programming is useful. But ...</p>
<h3 id="why-python">Why Python?</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the ABCs of programming, a.k.a. the <code>Hello World</code> program.</p>
<p>If you were to use <em>C</em>, you’d be punching in these few lines here:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p><em>Fortran</em> would be less intuitive and more ludicrous and make you type: program hello print *, &quot;Hello World!&quot; end program hello</p>
<p>While, with <em>Python</em>, you just have to say : print &quot;Hello World!&quot;</p>
<p>We can clearly see, Python reduces a lot of human time. Apart from doing that, it is: - Free - Widely used - Great for visualization</p>
<p>Now that we have (hopefully) convinced ourselves that studying Python is not a waste of time, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="built-in-types-and-variables"><strong>Built-in types and variables</strong></h2>
<p><em>Numbers</em></p>
<p>Python can easily substitute your calculator to help do basic math!</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>17+4</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>10*6</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>9-9</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>2**5</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>5%2</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Strings</em></p>
<p><code>&quot;Go Illini&quot;</code></p>
<p>Can also be written, <code>'Go Illini'</code></p>
<p>Python makes string concatenation (connection) trivial:</p>
<p><code>&quot;Go&quot; + &quot;Illini&quot;</code></p>
<p><em>Variables</em></p>
<p>Variables form the backbone of any program.</p>
<pre><code>x=3
x=&quot;It is too early in the morning&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The point here to note is that <code>x</code> does not need a pre-defined data type, as in other programming languages like C or C++. Python is smart enough to figure out <em>what</em> <code>x</code> is and adjust accordingly (but this slows it down a bit which is why many languages do not do this).</p>
<p>Note the difference between a variable and a string. I can have a variable <code>new=&quot;new&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-1"><strong>Exercise 1</strong></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the difference between <code>17/4</code> and <code>17/4.0</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>Print <code>&quot;It's too early in the morning&quot;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Using the numbers 4 and 6 the math operations: +, -, *, / print the number 8.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>x=&quot;abcde&quot;</code>, then what are <code>x[0]</code>, x[-1]<code>, and</code>x[1:]`?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Built-in Types</strong></p>
<p><em>Boolean</em></p>
<p>Can either be <code>True</code> or <code>False</code></p>
<pre><code>x=True
print x
x=False
print x</code></pre>
<p>Reverse it: <code>print not x</code></p>
<p>Question: Can you print <code>True</code> without assigning it to <code>x</code>? <em>i.e.</em>, without using any other operators?</p>
<p><strong>Aside: Comparison Operators</strong></p>
<pre><code>6 &gt; 4 #True
6 &lt; 4 #False</code></pre>
<p>Question: a=3 b=3.0 What is <code>a==b</code>? Why?</p>
<p><em>Lists</em></p>
<p>From strings and numbers, we are now moving to more compound datatypes.</p>
<p>Lists are collections of variables. In Python, lists are written as comma separated values within square brackets.</p>
<pre><code>myfirstlist= [1,2,3,4]</code></pre>
<p>Now we can manipulate all of these values as a unit. Where might you use this capability?</p>
<p>Some properties of lists:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Heterogenous: myfirstlist=[1,2,&quot;apple&quot;,3]</p></li>
<li><p>Can be sliced and indexed myfirstlist[0] #1 myfirstlist[-1] #3 myfirstlist[-3:] #[2,’apple’,3]</p></li>
<li><p>Lists are mutable myfirstlist[0]=&quot;orange&quot;</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2"><strong>Exercise 2</strong></h3>
<p>Try the following: myfirstlist.append(5) myfirstlist.insert(1,5) myfirstlist.sort() myfirstlist.reverse() myfirstlist.count(5) myfirstlist.remove(5)</p>
<p>Lists are associated with built-in ‘methods’ which is what you saw in the above exercise.</p>
<p><em>Tuples</em> A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>myfirsttuple=(1,2,&quot;apple&quot;,3)</code></pre>
<p>They are quite similar to lists in most ways. But try, myfirsttuple[0]=&quot;orange&quot;</p>
<p>So, tuples are _____________?</p>
<p><em>Dictionaries</em></p>
<p>A dictionary is a set of <code>key:value</code> pairs---in other words, an index to look up a data point. They are quite useful in advanced programming as we will see later on.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> myfirstdict = {‘a’:1, ‘b’:2, ‘c’:3} 'a' in myfirstdict #True</p>
<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops"><strong>Conditionals and Loops</strong></h2>
<p>So we now know variables, built in data types and comparison operators. So what do we do with all of this? We need to structure this into a program for which we need to understand conditionals and loops.To write a structured program, we need to be writing a Python script.</p>
<h3 id="writing-a-python-script"><strong>Writing a Python script</strong></h3>
<p>All this was done using the interactive Python interface. Now we will move on to writing Python scripts, or persistent text files which can be executed again and again.</p>
<p>To write a Python script, we need an editor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open the editor and write: <code>print &quot;This is a Python Script&quot;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Save as pythonscript.py</p></li>
<li><p>Run it from the command line: <code>python pythonscript.py</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conditionals"><strong>Conditionals</strong></h3>
<p>What are conditional statements?</p>
<pre><code>if (6&gt;4):
    print “True”
else:
    print “Not true”</code></pre>
<h3 id="exercise-3"><strong>Exercise 3</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a Python script to check if a number is even or odd or zero.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="loops"><strong>Loops</strong></h3>
<p>Why do we need loops?</p>
<p>There are many instances where you need to run the same lines of code multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Factorial</strong></p>
<pre><code>n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)…..*3*2*1
5!=5*4*3*2*1</code></pre>
<p>Without loops, we would need to write the same multiplication code 5 times.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-4"><strong>Exercise 4</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a Python script to check if a Number is prime or not. Use the definition of a prime number as one with only two factors---one and the number itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looping through lists</strong></p>
<p>Accessing and using lists is intrinsically linked to loops. For instance,</p>
<pre><code>mylist=[1,2,3,4]
for i in range(0,4):
    print i, mylist[i]</code></pre>
<h2 id="functions-and-libraries"><strong>Functions and Libraries</strong></h2>
<p>Python has quite a few built in standard libraries, and the extended library ecosystem is one of the major advantages to using Python today. To name a few: - <code>math</code> - <code>scipy</code> - <code>numpy</code></p>
<p>Each of these libraries have a number of modules or functions.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Using <code>math.sqrt</code> to find the square root</strong> import math print math.sqrt(9)</p>
<pre><code>from math import sort
print sqrt(9)

import math as mt
print mt.sqrt(9)</code></pre>
<p>Apart from the standard functions, we can declare user defined functions too.</p>
<p>The structure of a new function is: def function_name(input arguments): function defintion return output</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> def areaSquare(a): return a**2</p>
<h3 id="exercise-5"><strong>Exercise 5</strong></h3>
<p>Modify the previous exercise(to check for a prime number), to a function.</p>
<p>Each Python file can in turn be used as a library, where you import the Python file and function you need.</p>
<pre><code>import area
print area.areaSquare(2)</code></pre>
<h3 id="exercise-6-the-big-one"><strong>Exercise 6: the big one</strong></h3>
<p>Using the file which stores the Prime Number function, create a new Python script, where you declare a list of numbers (<code>x=1, 2 .. 100</code>). and loop through the numbers in the list to count the number of prime numbers.</p>
