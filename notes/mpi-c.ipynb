      "A classical computer processor receives instructions as sets of binary data from memory and uses these instructions (in assembly language) to manipulate data from memory in predictable ways.  A processor works on a single piece of data at a time (although other data units may be waiting in the registers or cache) and executes a single thread, or sequential list, of commands on the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus we may say that a conventional desktop computer is SISD\u2014*S*ingle *I*nstruction, *S*ingle *D*ata:  a single program operates on a single data element sequentially, then exchanges it back into memory and retrieves a new datum.  Any apparent multitasking is due to the operating system periodically switching the CPU's context from one thread to another.  We will represent this scenario in the following graphic, which shows a single processor interacting via a _bus_ (the wavy black band) with a collection of memory chips (which can be RAM, ROM, hard drives, etc.).\n",

      "Consider, for instance, the addition of two eight-element vectors.  If we have eight processors available, then each processor can add two corresponding elements from the two vectors directly; the program then yields an efficiently added single eight-element vector afterwards (if we assume little to no overhead costs for the _vectorization_ of the program).\n",

      "Imagine trying to calculate $\\pi$ by throwing darts at a circle.  We can count the number of darts that hit within the radius of the circle, $n_{\\text{circle}}$, and compare that value with the ratio of all darts within a bounding square, $n_{\\text{square}}$.  (Physical simulation of this process is left as an exercise to the reader.)  As we know the equations defining area, we can obtain $\\pi$ trivially:\n",

To test this, select a problem size suitable to scaling to a large number of processes (for instance, divisible by 64), and simply call larger and larger jobs while outputting timing information.\n",

Weak scaling can be tested in a straightforward manner by keeping track of the pieces of the puzzle each process is responsible for.  With strongly decomposable systems, like molecular dynamics or PDE solution on meshes, weak scaling can be revealing.  However, in my experience there are many types of problems for which solving for $N$ and solving for $N+1$ are radically different problems, such as in density functional theory where the addition of an electron means the solution of a fundamentally different physical system.\n",

[Gauss\u2013Seidel relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) is formally a better algorithm, since it also takes advantage of updated data points from _the current iteration_ to improve the subsequent data points in-flight as well.
