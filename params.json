{"name":"Python-Fa14","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in Python, Fall 2014","body":"All workshops will be held in L440 Digital Computer Laboratory, an EWS computer laboratory in the basement.  *If you are not an engineering student, you will need an EWS login to use the computer lab, so please email Neal Davis (contact information at bottom) at least 24 hours in advance.*\r\n\r\nThere is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Python](#intro)\r\n### Sep. 3 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students with little programming experience (in general) or with no prior exposure to Python.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what Python has to offer as a foundation for later tutorials throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Variables, functions, sequences, dictionaries\r\n- Libraries and modules\r\n- Loops, logic, and conditionals\r\n- Input/output, files\r\n\r\n(If you don't know what any or all of these are, don't worry!  We will explain them.)\r\n\r\n# [Numerical Programming with Python](#numpy)\r\n### Sep. 10 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis tutorial focuses on three key packages for scientific and numerical computing with Python:  [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), and [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/).\r\n\r\n[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is the foundational numerical module in modern Python (both 2 and 3).  NumPy provides the basic array manipulation and mathematical routines that are drawn upon by scientific classes.\r\n\r\n[SciPy](http://scipy.org/) is a collection of mathematical routines built on top of NumPy.  SciPy also provides convenience functions for scientific computing.\r\n\r\n[MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/) has become the workhorse for plotting in Python.  It offers a MATLAB-like syntax coupled with extremely flexible features for displaying data.\r\n\r\n# [Pandas (Python Data Analysis) Library](#pandas)\r\n### Sep. 17 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) module provides an R-like interface for manipulating and analyzing data sets and their statistics.\r\n\r\n# [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](#oop)\r\n### Sep. 24 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [The I-Python Environment & Notebooks](#ipython)\r\n### Oct. 1 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [MPI4Py](#mpi4py)\r\n### Oct. 8 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [PyOpenCL](#pyopencl)\r\n### Oct. 15 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Machine Learning in Python](#sklearn)\r\n### Oct. 22 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Debugging in Python (PDB)](#pdb)\r\n### Oct. 29 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [C & Fortran Interfaces](#api)\r\n### Nov. 5 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Numba & Optimization in Python](#numba)\r\n### Nov. 12 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Symbolic Manipulation with SymPy](#sympy)\r\n### Nov. 19 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# [Solving Problems on Graphs and Meshes with PyDEC](#pydec)\r\n### Dec. 3 • DCL L440\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\nNeal Davis and Lakshmi Rao developed these materials.
