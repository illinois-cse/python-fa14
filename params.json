{"name":"Python-Fa14","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in Python, Fall 2014 • DCL L440, 9–11 am","body":"All workshops will be held in L440 Digital Computer Laboratory, an EWS computer laboratory in the basement.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\n# Setup (Canopy Python and I-Python Notebook)\r\n\r\nFor most of the lessons, we will require outside modules.  While several methods for managing your own library of modules exists, we will use [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), which is installed on your EWS machines already.  However, it works best when you are logged in with a Canopy user account, and [free academic accounts](https://store.enthought.com/accounts/login/?next=/licenses/academic/request/) are available and recommended.\r\n\r\nTo load Canopy, please input the following at a terminal window:\r\n\r\n    module load canopy\r\n\r\nIn many cases, we will also use [I-Python](http://ipython.org/) notebooks, which are interactive workbooks for code.  To open these, please navigate on the command line to your home directory (or wherever your downloaded `ipynb` files are located), and open the I-Python notebook interface:\r\n\r\n    cd\r\n    module load canopy\r\n    ipython notebook &\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Python](#intro)\r\n### Sep. 3, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis workshop targets students with little programming experience (in general) or with no prior exposure to Python.  We will conduct a hands-on walkthrough of what Python has to offer as a foundation for later tutorials throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWe will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n- Variables, functions, sequences, dictionaries\r\n- Libraries and modules\r\n- Loops, logic, and conditionals\r\n- Input/output, files\r\n\r\n(If you don't know what any or all of these are, don't worry!  We will explain them.)\r\n\r\n[Link to Lesson](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/blob/gh-pages/notes/intro.md)\r\n\r\n# [Numerical Programming with Python](#numpy)\r\n### Sep. 10, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThis tutorial focuses on three key packages for scientific and numerical computing with Python:  [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org), and [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/).\r\n\r\n- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) is the foundational numerical module in modern Python (both 2 and 3).  NumPy provides the basic array manipulation and mathematical routines that are drawn upon by scientific classes.\r\n\r\n- [SciPy](http://scipy.org/) is a collection of mathematical routines built on top of NumPy.  SciPy also provides convenience functions for scientific computing.\r\n\r\n- [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/) has become the workhorse for plotting in Python.  It offers a MATLAB-like syntax coupled with extremely flexible features for displaying data.\r\n\r\n### Lesson Notebooks\r\n\r\nRight-click and _Save As..._ these `ipynb` files to your desktop.\r\n\r\n- [NumPy & SciPy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/numpy-scipy.ipynb)\r\n\r\n- [MatPlotLib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/matplotlib.ipynb)\r\n\r\n- [Scientific Coding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/coding.ipynb)\r\n\r\n- [Numerical Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/numerical-error.ipynb)\r\n\r\n### Support Files\r\n\r\n- [`fd-params.cfg`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/fd-params.cfg)\r\n\r\n- [`heat_eqn_cl.py`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/heat_eqn_cl.py)\r\n\r\n# [Pandas (Python Data Analysis) Library](#pandas)\r\n### Sep. 17, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) module provides an R-like interface for manipulating and analyzing data sets and their statistics.\r\n\r\n### Lesson Notebook\r\n\r\nRight-click and _Save As..._ this `ipynb` file to your desktop.\r\n\r\n- [Pandas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/pandas.ipynb)\r\n\r\nTo open it, please open a command line window and enter the following:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/Desktop\r\n    module load canopy\r\n    ipython notebook pandas.ipynb\r\n\r\n### Demonstration File\r\n\r\n- [PMU Data (w/ missing entries)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/pmu-data.csv)\r\n\r\n# [Object-Oriented & Advanced Programming in Python](#oop)\r\n### Sep. 24, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nWe will introduce modules, classes, and other advanced capabilities of Python, including list comprehension and `lambda` headless functions.\r\n\r\n### Lesson Notebooks\r\n\r\nRight-click and _Save As..._ these `ipynb` files to your desktop.\r\n\r\n- [OOP and Advanced Topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-fa14/gh-pages/notes/oop-intro.ipynb)\r\n\r\n# [The IPython Environment & Notebooks](#ipython)\r\n### Oct. 1, 9:00–11:00 • DCL L440\r\n\r\nThe [IPython](ipython.org) shell offers a number of useful and convenient enhancements to vanilla Python.
